# DjangoCon Europe 2015: Python & Django for PHP Nerds

This repo contains all resources required for my tutorial teaching PHP nerds how
to Python.  Standalone, the presentation probably isn't much use, but the 
examples and exercises should be enough to get someone on their way to 
understanding Python -- so long as they've got something of a PHP background.

The recommended way to use this tutorial is:

1. Know PHP
2. Try out the examples (following along with the presentation if you like)
3. Do the exercises in order
4. Go to the [Django website](https://djangoproject.com/) and do the
   [tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/).

Our tutorial on the Open Day will only be 2 hours long, so I'll do my best to
keep parts 1-3 limited to the first half, leaving you to experiment through the
tutorial and beyond for the latter half.

## Agenda

* 11:00 - 11:30  Welcome & Presentation
* 11:30 - 12:00  Examples & Exercises
* 12:00 - 13:00  The Django Tutorial

Depending on how we do for time, we may not get through the whole Django
tutorial, but that's ok.  The idea behind this session is to get you well on
your way from PHP to Python and feel comfortable with a Python framework like
Django.

## Further References & Development

Django is pretty awesome, and once you get the hang of it *so easy* to rapidly
develop and deploy.  If you'd like to advance further down your path toward a
life of Python & Django, I would recommend starting with a small project and
restricting yourself to solving typical problems with Python instead of the
tools you might be more comfortable with.

In terms of where to find more help in advancing your skills, that really
depends on your learning style preference.

* For those who like IRC, #django on Freenode is always busy
* For those who like books, there's [Dive into Python](http://www.diveinto.org/python3/) and [Two Scoops of Django](http://twoscoopspress.org/products/), both generally regarded as authoritative books on their respecive topics.
* For the redditors, there's [/r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython) and [/r/django](https://www.reddit.com/r/django).
* And then of course there's always a DjangoCon in [Europe](http://djangocon.eu/) and [North America](http://djangocon.us/).

But seriously, the best way to learn is to pick a project and start coding.
