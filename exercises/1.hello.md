Write a simple program that takes user input from the command line and prints
it out via standard out.  In other words, something like this:

    $ python myscript.py "Daniel"
    Hello Daniel!

You'll need to import the `sys` module and access its `argv` property.  If
you're lost or need to know details about an object, remember that `print()`
and `dir()` are your friends:

    print(some_object)       # Prints out the object
    print(dir(some_object))  # Prints out a list of properties of the object

Also, IPython is amazeballs.
