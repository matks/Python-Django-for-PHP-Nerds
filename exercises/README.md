# Exercises

Each of these exercises is meant to be done with the group, and are meant to
help you understand the ins-and-outs of the basic primitives in Python.  Note
that there's no Django-related stuff here, for that, we're going to do the
[Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/).  Note also
that these files are in markdown to make formatting easier, so it might be best
just to view them on GitHub rather than opening them locally.

Most of these exercises are written with the expectation that you have access to
the `exaples` portion of this repo, so feel free to look around there for hints
regarding what to do.  Of course, I'll be around too, so you can ask me as well.

* **0. Setup**: This will walk you through the process of setting up your local
   environment, whether you're running Linux, Mac OS, or Windows.
* **1. Hello**: The first exercise in any language, *"Hello World"*.
* **2. Calculator**: Basic math. We'll learn about passing arguments on the
   command line here too.
* **3. Foodz**: Explore primitives like `dict` and `list`.
* **4. People**: Classes, inheritance, etc.
