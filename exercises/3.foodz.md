Write a script that given a name, will return a list of foods they like. You
should account for the possibility that the user will give a name for which
you don't have a list of foods, and if they do not supply a name, it should
return a random person's likes.  Finally, it should keep in mind the
appropriate pronoun.

So, for example:

    $ python foodz.py Simonne

    Ah yes Simone, she likes:
      * Steak
      * Cheesecake
      * Chocolate

    $ python foodz.py Carmen

    Sorry, I have no idea who that is

    $ python foodz.py

    You didn't specify a name, so I'm picking one for you.
    Ah yes Henri, he likes:
      * Pizza
      * Chocolate

By this point you should be familiar with how to use `sys` to get the first
argument.

You will need to make use of a combination of dictionaries and lists to build
the "database" of users and their preferences.  Don't be afraid to nest
dictionaries inside dictionaries, or lists inside dictionaries etc.

Depending on how you structure your database, you may also want to make use of
the `.keys()` method on dictionaries, or the indexing properties of lists.

To handle the selection of a random user, take a look at the built-in `random`
module.  Some use of `random.choice` or even `random.randint` should get you
sorted.

Lastly, error handling of invalid users can be done either by way of an
`if/else` block, or `try/except`.  I would encourage you to try both of these
methods.
