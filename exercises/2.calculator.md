Write a crude calculator program that you can run from the command line.  It
should work like this:

    $ python mycalculator.py 2 + 2
    4

    $ python mycalculator.py 8 - 2
    6

    $ python mycalculator.py 6 x 8
    48

    $ python mycalculator.py 20 / 4
    5

    $ python mycalculator.py 20 / 3
    6.77
    
We're only going for basic calculations here, so there's no need to go crazy.
For this exercise, you'll need to use the lessons you learnt from the previous
one involving `sys` and you'll also have to make use of the casting functions
`int()` and `float()`, and finally for division with a remainder, take a look at
`round()`.
