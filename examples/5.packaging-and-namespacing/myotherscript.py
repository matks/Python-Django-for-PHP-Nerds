# You aren't required to import an entire package and its variables if you don't
# want to.  In fact, importing everything is generally a Bad Idea since you end
# up loading more into memory than you need.
#

# Import only the variable we want from the variables file
from variables import favourite_colour

print(favourite_colour)  # "blue"
