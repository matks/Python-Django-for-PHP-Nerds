# Examples

Most of these files are either PHP (`.php`) or Python (`.py`) files and can be
read in any plain-text capable program.  It will be easier however if you open
them in a program that understands how to highlight the syntax of these two
languages, so I recommend you either (a) view them in your code editor, or (b)
view them here on GitHub.

The last section, *8. Modules* is simply a markdown (`.md`) file, and GitHub
will handle the formatting for that as well.  Of course it's still quite
readable in a text editor though.
