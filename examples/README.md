# Examples

There are two sections here, but only **basic** is required to really get a
handle on Python and Django.  The **advanced** section is just fun and
interesting stuff that you might want to get your hands dirty with once you're
up and running.

Most of these files are either PHP (`.php`) or Python (`.py`) files and can be
read in any plain-text capable program.  It will be easier however if you open
them in a program that understands how to highlight the syntax of these two
languages, so I recommend you either (a) view them in your code editor, or (b)
view them on GitHub.

Section *basic/08. Modules* is simply a markdown (`.md`) file, and GitHub will
handle the formatting for that as well.  Of course it's still quite readable in
a text editor though.
