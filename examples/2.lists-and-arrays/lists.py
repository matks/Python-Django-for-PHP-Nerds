# Lists are just like PHP's indexed arrays
breakfast = ["eggs", "spam", "bacon", "pancakes", "oatmeal", "yogurt", "toast"]

breakfast[0]  # eggs
breakfast[2]  # bacon

# But lists in Python are *much* more featureful.  For example, using our
# breakfast list above:

breakfast[-1]   # toast
breakfast[2:4]  # ["bacon", "pancakes", "oatmeal"]
