* Show the difference between deploy styles
    * Include how PHP works: compile on each request etc.
    * Briefly mention how the Python/Django ecosystem hasn't settled
* Everything is an object vs. a list of functions
    * Overriding default object methods > the crazy shit you can do with Python
        * List-like or dictionary-like objects
        * Override `__str__` to be anything, including something that isn't a string
* Python 2 vs. 3






About Me

PHP
* Started as a templating language
* Grew into an international defacto standard
* Runs pretty much everywhere
* Weak, dynamic typing
    * "7" + 3 == 10

PHP
* Is being used for things it was never intended for
* Has some [serious design flaws](http://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/)
* Allows for some really terrible:
    * Coding styles
    * Design methodologies
* Lacks a module library

Python
* Is a [general-purpose language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Python_software)
    * Scientific research (Astropy, SciPy)
    * Data processing & visualisations (NumPy, Sagan, Matplotlib)
    * Media Managers (Calibre, Quod Libet)
    * Linux package management (Gentoo Portage, Ubuntu Software Centre)
    * Games (Civilization, Battlefield, Eve Online)
    * Websites (Reddit, The Onion)
    * Services (Dropbox, Trac, App Engine)

Python
* High-level (slower than C, but MUCH faster to write)
* Interpreted, but runtime-compiled
* Consistent behaviour
* Strong coding standards (white space, pep8)
* Throws exceptions when you screw up
* Strong, dynamic typing
    * "7" + 3  # Exception
